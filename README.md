# Moamen M.

**`Digital Craftsman (Full-Stack Web Developer)`**

I’m a Full-Stack Web Developer based in Alexandria, Egypt, driven by a passion for building digital systems that are clean, scalable, and meaningful. I don’t just write code; I craft solutions. Every project I’ve built was a chapter that I went through in my learning journey. Every chapter of my journey was packed with hands-on problem-solving, architecture brilliance, and real-world lessons and challenges.

From ideas and sketches to full deployment, I shape everything in these digital experiences with passion and engagement, blending functionality with design. Whether it's planning, building, debugging, or refining, I write systematic, professional code that leaves impact and presence. I'm a young, raw and aspiring talent in this industry and I'm going to break through. 

I'm currently expanding my skillset into the world of cybersecurity; a field that perfectly complements my interest in building secure, robust and complete systems while being able to detect and capitalize on flaws and vulenrabilities. My goal is to leave my mark in this industry by engineering systems that not only work, but work well, and are built to last.

# More than code — a lifelong pursuit of creation, curiosity, and control.

  <summary>Moamen's Journey</summary>
  
From the streets of Alexandria, Moamen grew up with a passion for Technology.

From the young age of six, Moamen started exploring computers and had always found himself fascinated by these sophisticated, magical machines.

As Moamen grew up, he started digging deeper into the parts and architecture of a computer and putting together his own computers. But with the curiosity that he had, Moamen wanted to know more. He wanted to know more about how systems worked, how the internet breathed, and how code could create something out of nothing. That spark never faded.

Growing older to the start of my teenage years, I found myself diving deeper and attending development courses where I was often the youngest in the room. While others were impressed by my curiosity and skills for my age, I saw it as just the beginning. I knew this wasn't about being ahead; it was about staying obsessed. I had a thing for this field; it was talent. And talent is an alternative word for obsession. It wasn't in my genes, I was simply fascinated.

Now, I build real-world full-stack applications and platforms that aid the community and solve problems. Each project is a baby step towards a bigger goal and wider vision of gaining a grip on technology and crafting his own presence in this alternate universe.

Moamen is focused on Full-Stack Web Development but with his amazing time management skills he is slowly but surely getting into a field that has long fascinated him. From being a white hat hacker that helps organizations and detects flaws to being a full cybersecurity system engineer was a power Moamen had always hoped to attain. that excites me. It's not just about writing code that works; it's about building systems that last, and systems that are safe.

With roots in Mechatronics and Robotics, and branches extending into Web Development and Cybersecurity, I’m not just chasing careers. I’m building my own ecosystem — a world I can both create and control.

If you’re looking to work with someone who treats this industry as more than a job, someone who sees tech as a craft, a cause, and a calling; Then I’d love to connect.
