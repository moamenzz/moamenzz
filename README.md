# Moamen M.

**`Digital Craftsman (Full-Stack Web Developer)`**

I’m Moamen Muhammed, a Full-Stack Web Developer based in Alexandria, Egypt.

I specialize in developing high-performance web applications using the MERN stack and Next.js, with a focus on clean architecture, scalable systems, and maintainable code. My experience spans the complete development lifecycle—from initial concept and system design to deployment and optimization.

Key Projects & Expertise:

- Built production-ready clones of major platforms (Spotify, Udemy, Pinterest, X/Twitter)
- Expertise in scalable backend architecture and database design
- Strong foundation in both front-end user experience and server-side optimization

Currently expanding into cybersecurity to enhance my ability to build secure, resilient systems. I'm passionate about creating digital solutions that don't just work—they're built to scale, perform, and endure.

Open to opportunities in full-stack development and emerging roles that bridge development with security.

# More than code — a lifelong pursuit of creation, curiosity, and control.

  <summary>Moamen's Journey</summary>
  
Technology chose me before I chose it. At six years old, I was that kid taking apart computers in Alexandria, fascinated by how these complex machines actually worked. What started as childhood curiosity evolved into something deeper—I wasn't just interested in using technology, I needed to understand it.

By my teens, I was the youngest person in development courses, driven by an obsession to know how systems communicate, how the internet functions, and how code transforms ideas into reality. While others saw talent, I knew it was simply relentless curiosity.

That foundation in hardware naturally led me to software. Today, I build full-stack applications that solve real problems, but each project serves a larger vision: mastering technology from multiple angles. My background in Mechatronics and Robotics taught me how systems work physically, while web development showed me how they work digitally.

Now I'm expanding into cybersecurity—not as a career pivot, but as the next logical step. Building secure systems requires understanding both how to create and how to break, how to develop and how to defend.
I don't just write code that works; I architect systems that last, scale, and stay secure. If you're looking for someone who treats technology as craft, not just career, let's connect.
